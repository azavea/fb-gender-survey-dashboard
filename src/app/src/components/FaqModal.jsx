                                between the 2020 and 2021 waves of the Survey on
                                Gender Equality at Home. For example, about half
                                of the questions in the 2021 questionnaire are
                                different from the 2020 questionnaire, and the
                                sample size was different for each wave. Visit

                                No. The sample for the 2020 questionnaire
                                included over 460,000 respondents across 208
                                geographies, compared to over 96,000 respondents
                                across 200 geographies in 2021. The country
                                selection page on this dashboard includes a
                                clarification for those geographies for which
                                only data from 2020 or 2021 is available.

                                Because of these differences, caution must be
                                given to drawing comparisons between regions or
                                countries across waves. For example, different
                                countries constituted the East Asia and Pacific
                                region in 2020 compared to in 2021.
